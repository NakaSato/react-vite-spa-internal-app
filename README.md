# React Vite TypeScript SPA with Tailwind and MUI

This project is a single-page application (SPA) built using React, Vite, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Material-UI (MUI). It serves as a template for developing modern web applications with a focus on performance and developer experience.

## Features

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Vite**: A fast build tool and development server for modern web projects.
- **TypeScript**: A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript, providing type safety.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
- **Material-UI (MUI)**: A popular React UI framework that provides pre-designed components.
