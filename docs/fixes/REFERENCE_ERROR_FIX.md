# ReferenceError Fix: "Cannot access before initialization"

## Issue Description
The error `Uncaught ReferenceError: Cannot access 'il' before initialization` was occurring due to circular dependency issues in the module system, specifically with lazy-loaded components being both statically and dynamically imported.

## Root Cause
The problem was caused by:

1. **Circular Dependencies**: Components were being both statically exported from index.ts files and dynamically imported via lazy loading
2. **Module Initialization Race Condition**: The bundler was trying to resolve the same module through multiple paths, causing initialization conflicts
3. **Static + Dynamic Import Conflict**: Vite was warning about components being both statically and dynamically imported

## Files Fixed

### 1. `/src/features/analytics/components/index.ts`
```typescript
// BEFORE (Problematic)
export { default as Analytics } from "./Analytics";
export { default as AnalyticsCharts } from "./AnalyticsCharts";
export { default as EnhancedAnalytics } from "./EnhancedAnalytics";

// AFTER (Fixed)
// Only export loaders to avoid circular dependencies
export { default as AnalyticsLoader } from "./AnalyticsLoader";
export { default as AnalyticsChartLoader } from "./AnalyticsChartLoader";
export { default as EnhancedAnalyticsLoader } from "./EnhancedAnalyticsLoader";
```

### 2. `/src/features/charts/components/index.ts`
```typescript
// BEFORE (Problematic)
export { default as GanttChart } from "./GanttChart";

// AFTER (Fixed)
// Only export loader to avoid circular dependencies
export { default as GanttChartLoader } from "./GanttChartLoader";
```

### 3. `/src/components/index.ts`
```typescript
// BEFORE (Problematic)
export * from "../features/analytics";
export * from "../features/charts";

// AFTER (Fixed)
export { AnalyticsLoader, AnalyticsChartLoader, EnhancedAnalyticsLoader } from "../features/analytics";
export { GanttChartLoader } from "../features/charts";
```

## Technical Explanation

### The Problem
When you have a component that is:
1. Statically exported from an index.ts file (`export { default as Component }`)
2. Dynamically imported via lazy loading (`lazy(() => import("./Component"))`)

The bundler tries to resolve the module through both paths simultaneously, creating a race condition where variables might be accessed before they are fully initialized.

### The Solution
- **Lazy-loaded components should NOT be statically exported** from index files
- Only export the loader components that handle the lazy loading
- This ensures a single, clear module resolution path

## Verification
- ✅ Build warnings about static/dynamic imports resolved
- ✅ Development server starts without errors
- ✅ No circular dependency warnings in build output

## Prevention
Added debug utilities in `/src/shared/utils/debugHelper.ts` to help identify similar issues in the future:
- `logModuleInit()` - Track module initialization
- `checkVariableAccess()` - Detect undefined variable access
- `safeAccess()` - Safe variable access with fallbacks
- `debugImport()` - Debug circular dependency imports

## Best Practices
1. **Separate Static and Dynamic Exports**: Never export the same component both statically and dynamically
2. **Use Loaders for Lazy Components**: Export loader components instead of the actual lazy-loaded components
3. **Avoid Deep Export Chains**: Minimize `export * from` chains that can create circular dependencies
4. **Test Module Loading**: Use the debug utilities in development to catch initialization issues early
